<h1>Animal Portfolio</h1>

<h3>This website is for creating small picture portfolios for your pets.</h3>

The challenges I came across making this project, were uploading multiple images. The documentation was scarce however this stackoverflow post really helped. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34006994/how-to-upload-multiple-images-to-a-blog-post-in-django">Post!</a>
<br>
The post is outdated but with lots of help from TA's I got my model to display multiple images.


Heres my <a href="https://github.com/Beck-Haywood/Animal-Portfolio/blob/master/proposal.md">Proposal</a>.
